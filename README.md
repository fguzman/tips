# Tips Calculator

This is a simple application for calculating tip given a certain bill total and tip percentage.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount and the application will determine a total amount the bill will cost after specifying a tip percentage (18% by default)
 
 * [x] Optional: Added a startup image, app icons, an initial animation and changed the layout/font/fontsizes/colors of the app.

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
